# Deploying a Microservices Application in Kubernetes

We're deploying a microservices-based **online shop application** into a Kubernetes cluster. This guide covers the process from preparing manifests to applying production best practices.

## Complete Process Workflow

This section focuses on deployment details: which microservices are involved, how they communicate, and their dependencies on third-party services or databases.

For example, some services use a message broker, others require a database. It's important to identify the entry-point microservice that handles browser requests.

### âœ… Key Steps:

- âœ… Created YAML files with **11 Deployment** and corresponding **Service manifests**
- âœ… All services are internal **except** the **Frontend Service**, which is accessible from a browser
- âœ… Created a Kubernetes cluster with **3 Worker Nodes** (e.g., on Linode or other cloud platforms)
- âœ… Connected to the cluster
- âœ… Created a **Namespace** and deployed all microservices
- âœ… Accessed the Online Shop via a browser

## Production & Security Best Practices

- **BP 1**: Added version to each container image  
- **BP 2**: Configured **Liveness Probes**  
- **BP 3**: Configured **Readiness Probes**  
- **BP 4**: Set **Resource Requests**  
- **BP 5**: Set **Resource Limits**  
- **BP 6**: Avoided using **NodePort** service type  
- **BP 7**: Configured **more than 1 replica** for each Deployment

## List of the Microservices in the Application

The application consists of the following microservices:

- `emailservice`
- `recommendationservice`
- `paymentservice`
- `productcatalogservice`
- `currencyservice`
- `shippingservice`
- `adservice`
- `cartservice`
- `checkoutservice`
- `frontend` _(with external access)_
- `redis-cart` _(third-party service)_

## Microservices Connection Graph

A connection graph helps visualize how services interact.

## Deployment and Service Configurations

We created 11 YAML filesâ€”1 for each deployment and its corresponding service.

```bash
kubectl apply -f emailservice.yaml
```

```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: emailservice
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: emailservice
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP

```

To apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f emailservice.yaml
```
