# MongoDB + Mongo Express Deployment on Kubernetes

## Project Demo

In this simple project, I outlined the process of deploying two applicationsâ€”MongoDB and Mongo Express. It is demonstrated to showcase a typical web application setup with a database. The deployment begins by creating a MongoDB pod along with an internal service, ensuring only other components within the same Kubernetes cluster can communicate with it. Next, a Mongo Express deployment is set up, requiring the MongoDB database URL and authentication credentials. These are passed into Mongo Express via environment variables, using a ConfigMap for the URL and a Secret for the credentials. To make Mongo Express accessible through a browser, an external service is created, allowing incoming HTTP requests to reach the Mongo Express pod. The request flow starts from the browser, reaches the external service, is forwarded to the Mongo Express pod, which connects to the internal MongoDB service, and communicates with the MongoDB pod using the provided credentials for authentication. This setup provides a simple yet effective way to connect a frontend application to a backend database within a Kubernetes environment.

### Base64 Encoding/Decoding for Secret

```bash
echo -n 'admin' | base64           # For db username
echo -n 'admin123' | base64        # For db password

echo -n 'base64-encoded-value' | base64 -d  # To decode
```

## Creating the Components using kubectl (in order)

```bash
kubectl apply -f mongo-secret.yaml  # Create the Secret containing MongoDB credentials
kubectl apply -f mongo.yaml         # Deploy the MongoDB pod and its internal service
kubectl apply -f mongo-configmap.yaml  # Create the ConfigMap with the MongoDB connection URL
kubectl apply -f mongo-express.yaml  # Deploy Mongo Express and expose it via an external service
```

---

## kubectl get commands (to check status and resources)

```bash
kubectl get pod  # List all pods in the current namespace
kubectl get pod --watch  # Continuously watch for pod status updates in real time
kubectl get pod -o wide  # Get more detailed info including node assignment and IPs
kubectl get service  # List all services (ClusterIP, NodePort, etc.)
kubectl get secret  # List all Secrets (credentials, tokens, etc.)
kubectl get all | grep mongodb  # Filter and view all MongoDB-related resources
```

---

## kubectl debugging commands

```bash
kubectl describe pod mongodb-deployment-xxxxxx  # Show detailed info and events for the MongoDB pod
kubectl describe service mongodb-service  # View service details including endpoints and selector labels
kubectl logs mongo-express-xxxxxx  # View logs from the Mongo Express pod
```

> Replace `xxxxxx` with the actual pod name.

---

## Access external service in Minikube

```bash
minikube service mongo-express-service  # Open Mongo Express in the default browser using its exposed NodePort URL
```

This will open a URL like:

```
http://<minikube-ip>:<node-port>
http:192.168.64.5:30000
```
